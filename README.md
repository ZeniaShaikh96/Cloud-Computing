# Cloud-Computing
 Automates AWS resource management using AWS SDK. Creates an EC2 instance, S3 bucket, and FIFO SQS queue. Lists resources, uploads a test file to S3, sends/retrieves messages in SQS, and logs actions. Deletes all resources, verifies cleanup, and ensures functionality with real-time updates and thorough testing.
